## Import data

Import all follow-up length dataset and separate to 3 groups

```{r}
followup_df = read_excel("./r-sm-rnp.xlsx") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(group, follow_up_length)

followup1_df = followup_df = read_excel("./r-sm-rnp.xlsx") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(group, follow_up_length) %>% 
  filter(group == 1)

followup2_df = followup_df = read_excel("./r-sm-rnp.xlsx") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(group, follow_up_length) %>% 
  filter(group == 2)

followup3_df = followup_df = read_excel("./r-sm-rnp.xlsx") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(group, follow_up_length) %>% 
  filter(group == 3)
```

## Check distribution

```{r}
skimr::skim(followup1_df)

skimr::skim(followup2_df)

skimr::skim(followup3_df)
```
